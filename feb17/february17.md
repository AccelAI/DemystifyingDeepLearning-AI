Topic:

We know that the best policies are based on data, but what about algorithms? Machine learning provides a massive opportunity to leverage existing data to research larger social trends - and we’ve only scratched the surface of how law and government can benefit from this. In this talk, we’ll discuss applying data science in this context, and how we as Data Scientists can positively impact the adoption of data science in law and government through public-facing projects.

![Jack Crawford](/img/jack.jpg)

[**Jack C Crawford - CEO & Founder @ Datalog.ai**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackcrawford)

>Jack leads a startup that provides a conversational AI platform for enterprise applications, software OEMs, and consumer facing bots that support customer engagement at scale.

>Over his career, he has bootstrapped three technology firms. Rey Consulting, Inc., which was named Oracle's leading middle-market reseller in North America was merged into to Computer Technology Associates as the Internet began to create new value organizations and consumers. In his next adventure, he joined a startup where he led the development of an enterprise online file sharing service that was subsequently acquired by AOL. They were a bit early, as this the "first Dropbox."

>His next firm began as a seed venture and pivoted into another bootstrapped firm. At Managed Ventures, he built a team where they developed an advanced application for chemical informatics and early drug discovery.

>And now, with private capital funding of $3M (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datalog-ai), he has kicked off datalog.ai, a firm that has already taken a leadership position in transformational AI.

>He believes in the power of a new way of looking at advancing technology. We can all help democratize Artificial Intelligence. It need not be a replacement for the way businesses or non-profit causes operate. Rather he sees AI as Additional Intelligence®– a platform that provides a foundation for increased value. Value for all of us.

Topic:

How to identify an opportunity for predictive AI within a business. Also, 3 things needed to successfully deliver these new capabilities to business owners.

##Speakers

![Rumman Chowdhury](/img/rumman.jpg)

[**Rumman Chowdhury - Senior Manager of AI @ Accenture**](http://www.rummanchowdhury.com/)

>Rumman's passion lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and humanity. She comes to data science from a quantitative social science background. Currently, she is a Senior Manager at Accenture, working on cutting edge applications of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, she serves on the Board of Directors for three AI startups.

>She holds two undergraduate degrees from MIT, and a Masters in Quantitative Methods of the Social Sciences from Columbia University. I am near completion of my PhD from the University of California, San Diego.

>More recently, she has emerged as a thought leader in the San Francisco Data Science community, with talks and tutorials at Intel Analytics Conference, Open Data Science Conference, Machine Learning Conference, Women Catalysts, PyBay, and Demystifying AI Conference.

>In mainstream media, she has been interviewed for the PHDivas podcast, German Public Television, and fashion line MM LaFleur. In 2017, she has upcoming talks at the Global Artificial Intelligence Conference, at Strata + Hadoop San Jose, Southern Data Science Conference, and Strata + Hadoop London.

Topics:

*Deep Learning for Reccomendation Systems

This talk will cover an overview of different types of recommender systems, with a focus on using deep learning for recommendation systems. Notable recent application areas are music recommendation, news recommendation, and session-based recommendation.

*Ethics in Artificial Intelligence


[**SIMON LYNCH - PRINCIPAL LECTURER @ TEESSIDE UNIVERSITY](https://www.tees.ac.uk/schools/scm/staff_profile_details.cfm?staffprofileid=U0020379)

>Dr. Simon Lynch is a Principal Lecturer in the School of Computing. Simon has worked at the School for 25 years with breaks to work in Sri Lanka and in Botswana. Simon's interests include international development, artificial intelligence and complexity.

>Simon's research investigates the activity of genetics, evolution, epidemiology and other naturally occurring systems that exhibit novel, emergent phenomena are not easily explained by traditional methods. His research addresses this through the production of animated, agent-based software models which visualise such emergent phenomena and the more general scientific principles which underpin their activity. This work currently reaches audiences through science centres, public engagement events and out-reach into schools and we are now seeking to extend the scope and the impact of this work.



![LAURA MONTOYA - FOUNDER & CEO @ ACCEL.AI](https://about.me/lauranmontoya)

>Laura is the Founder and CEO at Accel.ai. She has been described as a natural and versatile leader with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Research, and Psychology. Her personal interests include growth & empowerment, diversity, and community outreach.

>Laura graduated from High School at age 16 and worked full time to put herself through college, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, Physical Science, Human Development & Diversity.

>Her professional experience includes Research and Project Management, for such noteable organizations as University of Michigan Hospital, ChemTrend, and the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. She opted for a more technically challenging career and became a Software Engineer by completing an accelerated bootcamp program which taught web development in Ruby, Rails, and Javascript. Since then she has worked as an engineer at one of the largest Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Intuit.

>Most recently, she has begun specializing in Artificial Intelligence and has founded the first Accelerated program to train Artificial Intelligence Engineers. She is self taught in Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques.

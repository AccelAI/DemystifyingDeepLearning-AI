Topic: Test your ideas with scikit-learn

Good tools for testing and tinkering are important to understand any subject.  

Scikit-learn is an intuitive machine learning library for Python, leveraging Pythons flexibility with the speed of Scipy and Numpy to quickly get you up and running. Getting to know scikit-learn has been a fun and rewarding experience.

In this talk I will explain various features of scikit-learn by going through some examples. I will also touch briefly on the building blocks of scikit. The goal of the talk is to get you started with machine learning, and hopefully have a little fun.

There are no set-in-stone prerequisites for attending or understanding most of the content of this talk. However, some programming experience is highly recommended.

Please feel free to bring a laptop if you want to follow along.

>Simon's research investigates the activity of genetics, evolution, epidemiology and other naturally occurring systems that exhibit novel, emergent phenomena are not easily explained by traditional methods. His research addresses this through the production of animated, agent-based software models which visualise such emergent phenomena and the more general scientific principles which underpin their activity. This work currently reaches audiences through science centres, public engagement events and out-reach into schools and we are now seeking to extend the scope and the impact of this work.

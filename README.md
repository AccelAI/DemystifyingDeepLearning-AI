#DEMYSTIFYING DEEP LEARNING & AI - NOV 19TH-20TH, 2016

Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning are the current buzzwords of the tech industry. So, have you been wondering what all the fuss is about?

Have you wanted to incorporate AI into your products, but have no idea where to start? Are you letting terms like 'Big Data' or 'Differential Calculus Equations' intimidate you from being a part of the leading edge of this technology?

JOIN US for an all weekend, hands on workshop series Demystifying Deep Learning & AI. You will have the opportunity to gain insight & hear lighting talks from World Class Engineers in the field.

Learn how to use the latest AI open source platforms including:

-SciKit
-Tensor Flow
-ConvNetJS
-Keras


Network & Mingle with PhD students, faculty members, and industry research scientists. Share your projects and vision for the future of Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence.

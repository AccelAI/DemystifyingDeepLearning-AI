###Advanced Sessions:


**Internal workings of a convnet and the process of implementing it on Spark with Jeremy Nixon**

*Abstract*

ELEGANCE OF CNNS IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Convolutional Neural Networks are as elegant as they are tremendously successful in practical applications. This talk will demonstrate how they operate at a low level, and then provide a number of diverse viewpoints on interpreting their performance. Those views will include manifold learning, representation learning, automating feature engineering and more.




**Overfitting and regularisation in Machine learning with Dmytro Lituiev**

*Abstract*

OVER-FITTING IN DEEP LEARNING

Over-fitting, a phenomenon when a model explains well the data set it has seen, but fails to generalize to the new data is common to both simple linear models and complex deep neural networks. This workshop will provide intuition of such behavior and discuss ways to prevent it. In particular, we will focus on a weight penalization as a way to improve generalization. We will implement and train a model and look at it from probabilistic and linear algebra perspective.

**Classifying images using DCNN in Keras with Sujit Pal**

*Abstract*

DCNNS IN KERAS

This talk will describe how a Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) trained on the ImageNet dataset can be used to classify images in a completely different domain. The intuition that the training process teaches the DCNN to extract good features from images is explored with visualizations. Transfer Learning freezes the bottom layers of the DCNN to extract image vectors from a training set in a different domain, which can then be used to train a new classifier for this domain. Fine tuning involves training the pre-trained network further for the target domain. Both approaches are demonstrated using a VGG-16 network pre-trained on ImageNet to classify medical images into 5 categories. Code examples are provided using Keras.

**In depth look at Word2Vec with Andy Zhang**

*Abstract*

DEEP LEARNING MATH BY EXAMPLE

A case study with word2vec, a commonly used technique for pre-training word embeddings. What is the training process doing, what is being learned, and why do they work? The intuition gained will be useful for thinking about how language models with embeddings are trained in general.

###Lightning Talks:


**Did Big Data Fail us in the Presidential Election? with Rumman Chowdhury**

*Abstract*

DID BIG DATA FAIL US IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?

Not a single major poll, megapoll, or survey in this election successfully predicted the outcome. As a result, an already skeptical American population is experiencing a big data backlash. What happened? Is our faith in big data misguided? In this short talk, I discuss how the misconceptions in the data science community about the accuracy of models and polling, combined with a basic lack of understanding and explanation in the public about statistical models and their outcomes, led to arguably the biggest Big Data debacle since Google Flu Trends.

**Incorporating ML into Robotics & Computer Vision with Carlos Uranga**

*Abstract*

MACHINE LEARNING FOR ROBOTICS

What is a robot? Why is A.I. important in personal robotics? We now have the ability to digest enormous amounts of data, to read our own thoughts, and are now able to prevent disease - rather than treating it. The era of personalized robotics is upon us, designed for you, better serving us as individuals. This next era of robotic automation, brings them out of the factories ( big industry), and into our everyday lives; much of this, will be enhanced and accelerated by A.I.
